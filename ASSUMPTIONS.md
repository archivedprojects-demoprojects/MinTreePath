### List of assumptions made: ###
1. List can only be traversed in one direction:
    1. If going downwards, tree traversal cannot go up to parent and down to another leaf.
    2. Example provided in requirements_thought_highlevel_logic text file.
2. A parent can have only two children.
3. Leaf has a limited number of parents:
    1. One parent   :- if on the far right/left of the tree
    2. Two parents  :- otherwise
    3. Exception made to first node (has not parents only children)
