Requirements
-Must make use of lambda calculus (Function concepts)
-Algorithm able to handle 500 row triangles

Thought
-Max number of possible paths for a single leave === length of tree - 1
--Assuming the tree traversal is only one directional
--Example:- Possible paths to get to leave 1
            Tree:
            7
            6  3
            3  8 5
            11 2 10 9
            15 1 7  6 13

            Accepted paths:
            - 7-6-3-11-1
            - 7-6-3-2-1
            - 7-6-8-2-1
            - 7-3-8-2-1
            Unaccepted paths:
            - 7-3-5-10-8-2-1 (in this scenario, we went upwards from 10 to 8 - we are assuming that this is not allowed
                                The tree can only be traversed bottom up or top down)

High-Level Logic
-Bottom up vs Top down approach (memoization)
-Dynamics Programming vs Naive approach
-Test time complexity of both approaches
-Make use of concurrency

Algorithm disadvantages:
-Traversal of the tree: top down; This is because largest node would be the parent and we can go downwards from their
-Sum of the paths must be calculated prior to finding the shortest path
-Not making use of multi-threading
    -can be implemented to read file from the end and start parsing shortest path at the same time

Algorithm advantages:
-Traversal of the tree is optimal (making use of recursion)
-Calculation of the new tree is not wasteful - to check if can be optimised further
-File reading has been made optimal through lambda java expressions
